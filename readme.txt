== Description ==

When using a theme with Theme Blvd framework version 2.0.0+, this plugin is will allow you to completely hide the theme's admin presence. All of your settings will remain in tact, but the theme's admin pages will simply be hidden.

= Who is this plugin for? =

I have a feeling this plugin will be most useful for those creating a site for their clients and want to hide the theme's admin presence from them so they can't mess with anything. Oh, those pesky clients! :-)

= How does it work? =

It really couldn't be more simple. When you activate the plugin, your Theme Blvd theme's admin presence will be hidden. This includes the Theme Options panel, Widget Area manager, Slider manager, and Layout Builder. To get the admin pages back, just de-activate the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-blvd-admin-presence` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress to hide your theme's admin pages.
